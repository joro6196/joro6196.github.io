        <h1>Josh Robinson (he/him)</h1>
        <p>I am a Junior majoring in two business emphases. I was born and raised in Colorado and I am also pursuing the CTD minor in an effort to explore my creative side and learn new programs related to design. I enjoy reading, hiking, camping, and you can always find me hanging out with my friends when I am not busy with work or school. </p>
        <p>My <em>favorite</em> youtube video is <a href="https://youtu.be/h6fcK_fRYaI?si=ljW-USVmVhj0mqap"><em>The Egg</em></a>. It is a visually aesethic animation highlighting the importance of not dwelling on small mistakes  and being kind to one another through a hypothetical after-life story. </p>
        <p>As a <em>Marketing</em> and <em>Business Analytics</em> major, I learn the importance of combining marketing tactics with data-driven decision making. While the contents of this course are more creativity based, one of my main goals is to add one or more coding languages to my skillset in order to take that on to personal projects or ones relating to my future work. </p>
