    <h2 id="overview">Overview</h2>
    <p>The Milky Way is a vast and majestic spiral galaxy that serves as the home to our solar system, including <a href="https://science.nasa.gov/earth/">Earth</a>. It is comprised of billions of stars, along with gas, dust, and dark matter, all held together by gravity. From our vantage point within the Milky Way, it appears as a faint band of light stretching across the night sky. It has been a staple subject for photophers, movie scenes, and more because of its beauty. Its prescence has served as an important discovery not only for the understanding space but understanding the future of where humanity might expand to in the event Earth is no longer habitable.

    <h2 id="history">History</h2>
    <p>The history of the Milky Way spans billions of years and is a clear exemplification of evolution within the universe. It began with the formation of a vast cloud of gas and dust that collapsed under its own gravity, giving birth to the Milky Way's first stars and structures. Over time, these stars collected into dense regions, forming the galaxy's distinctive spiral appearance. Throughout its history, the Milky Way has undergone periods of intense star formation, stellar explosions, and interactions with neighboring galaxies. All of these events have and continue to slowly shape its morphology and composition. Evidence suggests that the Milky Way has merged with and cannibalized smaller near-by galaxies, contributing to its growth and complexity. Today, the Milky Way continues to evolve, with ongoing processes such as star formation, supernovae, and black hole activity shaping its future trajectory. <a href="https://www.britannica.com/biography/Galileo-Galilei">Galileo Galilei</a> first resolved the band of light into individual stars with his telescope in 1610 and until the early 1920s, most astronomers thought that the Milky Way contained all the stars in the Universe. On the contrary, observations by <a href="https://www.britannica.com/biography/Edwin-Hubble">Edwin Hubble</a> showed that the Milky Way is just one of many galaxies in the universe.</p>
    <h2 id="features">Features</h2>
    <p>The Milky Way has a rich array of features that not only captivate astronomers, but regular individuals and enthusiasts alike. The galaxy is home to a variety of planets (like <a href="https://tessahammond.me/wa/wa3.html">Saturn</a>) and stars, but its defining characteristic is its elegant spiral structure that contains "arms" where new stars are birthed amidst swirling clouds of gas and dust. Nestled within these spiral arms are star clusters of various ages and sizes, from ancient globular clusters to young open clusters. At the galaxy's heart lies a supermassive black hole, exerting its gravitational influence over the surrounding stars and material. The Milky Way also hosts stunning celestial phenomena, including nebulae illuminated by the light of nearby stars and pulsars flashing like cosmic lamps. With its dynamic and diverse array of features, the Milky Way serves as a captivating laboratory for studying the mysteries of galactic evolution, stellar dynamics, and the cosmos at large.</p>
